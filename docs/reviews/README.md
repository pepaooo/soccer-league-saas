# Documentation Reviews

This directory contains reviews, verifications, and update summaries organized by date and topic.

## Purpose

As the project evolves, we conduct periodic reviews to:
- Verify implementation matches specification
- Document gaps and improvements
- Track changes and updates
- Maintain quality standards

## Structure

Each review is organized in a dated folder:

```
reviews/
└── YYYY-MM-DD-topic-name/
    ├── 00-REVIEW_SUMMARY.md       # Start here - overview of entire review
    ├── 01-*.md                     # Detailed findings
    ├── 02-*.md                     # Updates made
    ├── 03-*.md                     # Verification results
    └── ...                         # Additional documents
```
