# QUICKSTART.md - How to Use This Implementation Plan

## üéØ Purpose

This guide shows you **exactly how** to use the PROJECT_SETUP.md and IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md files with AI coding assistants (Cursor IDE or Claude Code) to build your SaaS platform efficiently.

---

## üìÅ File Structure You'll Have

```
your-computer/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ soccer-saas-docs/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PROJECT_SETUP.md           ‚Üê Complete setup guide
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md  ‚Üê Sprint-by-sprint tasks
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ QUICKSTART.md              ‚Üê This file
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ PROGRESS.md                ‚Üê Track your progress (create this)
```

---

## üöÄ Step-by-Step: Getting Started

### Step 1: Save These Files Locally

```bash
# Create project documentation folder
mkdir ~/soccer-saas-docs
cd ~/soccer-saas-docs

# Save the markdown files here (copy from the artifacts above)
# You should have:
# - PROJECT_SETUP.md
# - IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md
# - QUICKSTART.md (this file)
```

### Step 2: Create Your Project Folder

```bash
# Create main project directory
mkdir ~/projects/soccer-league-saas
cd ~/projects/soccer-league-saas

# Initialize Git
git init
```

### Step 3: Open in Your IDE

**Option A: Cursor IDE (Recommended)**
```bash
cursor ~/projects/soccer-league-saas
```

**Option B: VS Code with Copilot**
```bash
code ~/projects/soccer-league-saas
```

**Option C: Claude Code (CLI)**
```bash
cd ~/projects/soccer-league-saas
# Use Claude Code commands directly in terminal
```

## üíª How to Work with Cursor IDE

### Method 1: Inline AI Chat (Best for Quick Tasks)

1. Open the file you want to create (e.g., `TenantContext.java`)
2. Press `Cmd+K` (Mac) or `Ctrl+K` (Windows)
3. Copy-paste the relevant prompt from IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md
4. Hit Enter and let Cursor generate the code
5. Review, test, and accept the changes

**Example:**

```
File: backend/src/main/java/com/ligamanager/config/TenantContext.java

1. Create empty file
2. Cmd+K
3. Paste this prompt:

"Create a TenantContext class using ThreadLocal to store the current tenant ID. 
Include methods: setTenantId(String), getTenantId(), and clear(). 
Use Java 21 and follow Spring Boot best practices."

4. Review generated code
5. Save file
```

### Method 2: Sidebar Chat (Best for Complex Tasks)

1. Open Cursor sidebar (Cmd+L)
2. Reference the PROJECT_SETUP.md file in your prompt:
   ```
   @PROJECT_SETUP.md
   
   I want to implement the multi-tenancy setup from Day 1-2.
   Create TenantContext, TenantInterceptor, and TenantIdentifierResolver.
   Follow the specifications in this document.
   ```
3. Cursor will read the file and generate code based on it
4. Apply suggested changes

### Method 3: Composer (Best for Multi-File Changes)

1. Open Composer (Cmd+I)
2. Use it for tasks that span multiple files:
   ```
   Create the complete League management module:
   - League.java entity
   - LeagueRepository.java
   - LeagueService.java
   - LeagueController.java
   - LeagueRequest/Response DTOs
   
   Follow the specifications in IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md Sprint 2, Day 11-12
   ```
3. Cursor will create/modify multiple files at once

## üîß How to Work with Claude Code (CLI)

Claude Code is a command-line tool for agentic coding.

### Basic Workflow

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd ~/projects/soccer-league-saas/backend

# Start a coding session with context
claude-code "Create the multi-tenancy setup as specified in ~/soccer-saas-docs/PROJECT_SETUP.md. 
Focus on TenantContext, TenantInterceptor, and Hibernate configuration."

# Claude Code will:
# 1. Read your files
# 2. Create/modify files
# 3. Run tests
# 4. Show you a diff
# 5. Ask for approval before committing

# Review and approve changes
```

### Iterative Development

```bash
# After each task, give feedback
claude-code "The TenantInterceptor is not extracting the subdomain correctly. 
Fix it to handle the format: {tenant-key}.ligamanager.com"

# Or ask for tests
claude-code "Write unit tests for the TenantContext class using JUnit 5 and Mockito"
```

---

## üìã Recommended Workflow (Day-by-Day)

### Daily Routine

```
Morning (30 min):
1. Open IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md
2. Read today's tasks (e.g., Sprint 1, Day 1-2)
3. Create a checklist in PROGRESS.md
4. Review the prompts you'll use

Coding Session (3-4 hours):
1. Work through tasks one-by-one
2. Copy prompt from roadmap ‚Üí Paste in Cursor/Claude Code
3. Review generated code carefully
4. Test each component before moving on
5. Commit to Git after each completed task

Evening (30 min):
1. Update PROGRESS.md with completed tasks
2. Note any blockers or questions
3. Plan tomorrow's work
```

### Example: Sprint 1, Day 1 Workflow

```bash
# 1. Complete project setup (morning)
cd ~/projects/soccer-league-saas
# Follow PROJECT_SETUP.md Step 1-5
docker-compose up -d

# 2. Create TenantContext (1 hour)
# Open: backend/src/main/java/com/ligamanager/config/TenantContext.java
# Cmd+K in Cursor ‚Üí Paste prompt from IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md
# Test it works

git add .
git commit -m "Add TenantContext for multi-tenancy"

# 3. Create TenantInterceptor (1 hour)
# Repeat process

git add .
git commit -m "Add TenantInterceptor to extract tenant from subdomain"

# 4. Test multi-tenancy (1 hour)
# Write a simple integration test
# Verify tenant extraction works

# 5. Update PROGRESS.md
# Mark Day 1-2 tasks as complete
```

---

## üìä Tracking Progress

Create a `PROGRESS.md` file to track your work:

```markdown
# Project Progress

## Sprint 1: Foundation & Multi-Tenancy

### Week 1
- [x] Day 1-2: Multi-tenancy Core ‚úÖ (Jan 15-16)
  - [x] TenantContext
  - [x] TenantInterceptor
  - [x] TenantIdentifierResolver
  - [x] MultiTenantConnectionProvider
- [ ] Day 3-4: Domain Entities
- [ ] Day 5-7: Authentication & JWT
- [ ] Day 8-10: Frontend Auth

### Week 2
...

## Blockers
- Need to figure out subdomain configuration in local dev
- Flyway migration failing (resolved)

## Questions for AI
- How to test multi-tenancy locally without real subdomains?
- Best practice for JWT secret management?

## Completed Milestones
- ‚úÖ Jan 16: Multi-tenancy working locally
- ‚úÖ Jan 18: Authentication flow complete
```

## üé® Best Practices for AI-Assisted Development

### ‚úÖ DO

1. **Give specific prompts**: Copy exact prompts from IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md
2. **One task at a time**: Don't ask AI to build entire sprint in one go
3. **Review all code**: AI makes mistakes, always read generated code
4. **Test immediately**: Run tests after each component
5. **Commit frequently**: One commit per completed task
6. **Ask for explanations**: "Explain how this TenantIdentifierResolver works"
7. **Iterate**: If code doesn't work, ask AI to fix it with error details

### ‚ùå DON'T

1. **Accept code blindly**: Always understand what AI generated
2. **Skip testing**: AI-generated code often has edge case bugs
3. **Make huge commits**: Small commits = easier to debug
4. **Ignore warnings**: If AI says "this approach has limitations", listen
5. **Forget documentation**: Ask AI to add comments to complex code
6. **Rush**: Follow the roadmap pace, don't skip steps

## üõ†Ô∏è Useful Prompts for Common Situations

### When Stuck

```
"I'm stuck on implementing [feature]. Here's the error:
[paste error]

Here's my current code:
[paste code]

Based on IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md Sprint [X] Day [Y], 
how should I fix this?"
```

### When Code Doesn't Work

```
"This generated code for [component] isn't working as expected.
Here's what's happening: [describe issue]
Here's what should happen: [expected behavior]
Please debug and fix the code."
```

### When You Need Tests

```
"Write comprehensive unit tests for this [class/method] using JUnit 5 and Mockito.
Test edge cases and validation logic. Aim for 90%+ coverage."
```

### When You Need Documentation

```
"Add JavaDoc comments to this class explaining:
- Purpose of the class
- Parameters and return values
- Any important notes or edge cases
- Usage examples"
```

## üîç Verifying Your Work (Checkpoints)

After each task, verify it works:

### Backend Verification

```bash
# 1. Compile (no errors)
mvn clean compile

# 2. Run tests
mvn test

# 3. Start application
mvn spring-boot:run

# 4. Test API with curl
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/signup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@test.com","password":"test123"}'

# 5. Check database
psql -U ligamanager -d ligamanager
\dt  # List tables
SELECT * FROM public.tenants;
```

### Frontend Verification

```bash
# 1. Build (no errors)
npm run build

# 2. Run dev server
npm run dev

# 3. Open browser
open http://localhost:3000

# 4. Check console (no errors)
# Open DevTools ‚Üí Console

# 5. Test flow

## üÜò Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: AI generates outdated code

**Solution**: Specify versions explicitly
```
"Create this using Spring Boot 3.2, Java 21, and the latest Spring Security.
Do NOT use deprecated methods."
```

### Issue: Code doesn't match project structure

**Solution**: Provide context
```
"In my project, the package structure is com.ligamanager.config.
Generate the TenantContext class following this structure."
```

### Issue: AI hallucinates non-existent libraries

**Solution**: Verify and constrain
```
"Only use libraries that are in my pom.xml:
- Spring Boot Starter Web
- Spring Data JPA
- PostgreSQL Driver
Do NOT use any other dependencies."
```

### Issue: Tests fail after AI generates them

**Solution**: Iteratively fix
```
"These tests are failing with this error: [paste error]
Fix the tests to use the correct assertions and mocking."
```
